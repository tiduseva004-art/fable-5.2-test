Make "Daybreak Switch", No. 062 in a series of web material studies: a night-to-morning toggle in its own original style, as a single self-contained page (no libraries; raw WebGL2 + Web Audio + a 2D pixel buffer). Editorial layout: a small "Material Studies / No. 062 · WebGL + Web Audio" kicker, an italic serif title "Daybreak Switch.", a one-line caption; the switch centred and large; below it readouts (Clock, Light, Music), a hint line and a "Sound on/off" button. The whole page's colours (background, text, lines) follow the switch from a dark dusk-indigo at night to a pale lavender-grey by day. Works at phone width.

THE SWITCH
- A pill-shaped switch in a moulded bezel: white glossy plastic by day, graphite by night. A soft drop shadow falls on the page and fades to nothing before the canvas edge, with a slight inner shadow along the top of the track.
- Inside, a 176×50 pixel-art room, redrawn every frame on the CPU and shown with nearest sampling, never smoothed. Whole device pixels per scene pixel where there is room.
- The knob is a vertical capsule of clear jelly glass, a little taller than the track, drawn in one full-canvas WebGL2 fragment shader:
  - it magnifies (~1.28×) and bends the pixels under it;
  - it splits R/G/B at its rim, with a darker refraction band, a bright edge and a Fresnel tint;
  - two highlights: a long soft streak at the upper left and a small dot at the lower right;
  - light focused toward its foot, and a soft shadow on the room.
- The knob lags the finger on a spring, stretches horizontally with speed (squashing vertically to keep its volume), and wobbles on a damped spring fed by its acceleration.
- Inside the knob the room is always shown fully lit: the glass carries the morning.
- Controls: drag the knob or drag anywhere on the track; tap to toggle to the other end (it travels there on its spring); arrow keys, Home/End, Space/Enter; role="slider" with aria values.

THE ROOM (original, cosy palette)
Built from filled shapes stamped with an automatic 1-px outline and a light top / dark bottom, so every object reads as a pixel sprite:
- butter-yellow diamond wallpaper, teal wainscot, plank floor, a coral/cream/teal striped rug;
- a big window with curtains over a town of roofs;
- a shelf of coloured jelly jars and books, a potted plant;
- a brass floor lamp with a mint shade;
- a red boombox on a wooden cabinet, a framed picture of a little jelly shark, a round wall clock, a blue panelled door;
- a string of coloured bulbs sagging across the ceiling;
- a purple pet bed under the window.

LIGHT AND THE MORNING
- The knob drags the dawn across the room: left of it is day, right of it still night (indigo ambient). The edge dissolves in a 4×4 Bayer dither, with a warm dawn band just behind the knob.
- The window sky runs from night (navy, twinkling stars, a crescent moon, lit town windows) through dawn (violet to peach, the sun coming up) to day (blue, sun high, clouds drifting).
- Moonlight shafts through the window at night, warm sun shafts by day.
- The lamp clicks on early and casts a banded warm pool.
- Each ceiling bulb lights as the knob passes it, with a coloured dithered glow.
- Disco spots sweep the room at the party.
- The wall clock runs from 02:00 to 10:00.

THE STORY, BY POSITION
- An orange tabby cat:
  - asleep, curled in its bed, breathing, with z's rising;
  - awake, lying with its head up and blinking;
  - sitting up;
  - standing and walking out onto the rug;
  - at the end dancing on its hind legs to the beat, in sunglasses, with pink ghost trails.
- The plant sways and the boombox speakers thump with the beat; music notes float up from the boombox.
- A disco ball comes down from the ceiling; confetti sparkles fall.
- Glowing crescent echoes (coral to pink) trail behind the moving knob.
- Near the end (from about 08:24 on the clock) a puppy waits outside: warm light shows under the door with the shadows of its shifting paws, and it knocks. On each knock the door jolts 2 px, arcs of sound spring off it, and a "!" pops up over the cat; the knocking repeats every ~2.8 s until it's let in. At the very end the door swings open on a warm orange hallway and a white puppy with brown ears comes in, bobbing to the beat.

SOUND — all synthesised live with Web Audio, original music
- 100 BPM, a four-bar loop in F (Fmaj7 · Am7 · Dm7 · B♭maj7), on one lookahead-scheduled clock with a little swing.
- Layers fade in by the knob's position:
  0. Night: crickets (AM-chirped sine trains) and soft wind.
  1. A music box arpeggiating the chords (bell partials, short room reverb).
  2. A lo-fi beat (kick, noise-and-tone snare, hats) and a round bass.
  3. Warm detuned pads and a square-wave tune with vibrato.
  4. The party: four on the floor, claps, open hats, sub bass, the rest of the mix pumping under the kick.
- The music sits behind a low-pass that opens with the dawn, and ~5 dB under the switch's own sounds.
- Switch sounds:
  - a glass tink plus a jelly blop when grabbed, a plop when released;
  - a band-passed noise rub following the drag speed;
  - a pentatonic pluck for every bulb lit (a glissando when you sweep across), softer and lower when one goes out;
  - the lamp's double click and a cat's "mrrp" (formant-filtered saw) when it wakes;
  - a riser and crash into the party, and a record-brake when you drag back out of the beat;
  - the puppy's yip when it comes in.
- The knock, like a real heavy door knock: three hits 0.25 s apart, panned toward the door. Each hit is a knuckle click (band-passed noise) over a deep thump that sags from ~98 to ~60 Hz over a quarter second, with quicker overtones (190→128 Hz, 410 Hz) and soft saturation so small speakers hear it. The music ducks to ~45% under each hit, and the knocks peak at 3–4× the music's level.
- Audio starts on the first touch; a Sound on/off button.
- Readouts: Clock (02:00–10:00), Light (Night / First light / Sunrise / Morning / Party), Music (Crickets / Music box / Beat / Band / Party).
